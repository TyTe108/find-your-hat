# find-your-hat

## Description
"find-your-hat" is a terminal maze-solving game developed using Node.js. The objective of the game is to navigate through a field and find the hat while avoiding holes. If you fall into a hole or go out of bounds, the game is over.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Launch the game by running the command: `node main.js`
4. The game will display the current state of the field.
5. You will be prompted to choose a direction to move in (up, down, left, or right).
6. Navigate through the field to find the hat (`^`).
7. Avoid falling into holes (`O`).
8. Your path will be marked with an asterisk (`*`).
